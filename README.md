Analyzes whether **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** characteristics help explain S&P 500 stock return variation using econometric models.

## Objectives
- Merge ESG scores with S&P 500 stock price data.
- Engineer E, S, and G factor proxies and control variables.
- Run regressions to quantify ESG–return relationships.

## Data Sources
- ESG Ratings dataset (demo/sample data)
- Yahoo Finance historical prices
- Risk-free rate from FRED

## Methods & Tools
- **Python:** pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, linearmodels
- **Econometrics:** Fama-MacBeth regressions, panel fixed effects, robust errors

## Results
- ESG composite score significantly correlated with returns (t ≈ X.X)
- Environmental sub-score showed strongest link to returns
